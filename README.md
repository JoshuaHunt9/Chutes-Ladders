# Chutes-Ladders

This is a console recreation of the game chutes &amp; ladders. The premise is that two players are competting to be the first to reach the 100th square by rolling dice and moving their "character". First to the 100th square or beyond wins, or by luckily landing on a random "golden square". The "squares" you land on can determine if you go back or up 1 square.
